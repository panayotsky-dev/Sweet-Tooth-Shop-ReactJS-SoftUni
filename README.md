Hello! As the developer of the Sweet Tooth e-shop project, I am happy to share with you some further details about the project and how it was developed.
 
 Project is deployed at vercel : https://sweet-tooth.vercel.app

### Project Description:

Sweet Tooth is an e-shop that sells coffee and sweet products. The website is built using **ReactJS**, **Framer-Motion**, and **TailwindCSS**. The website has an **attractive UI design** with a **modern look** and feel. The website uses **Firebase** for the database, storage, and **authentication with Google**.

### Features:

**1. Logo and Product Design:**
#### The logo and product design were created using Adobe Illustrator to give the website a unique and professional look.

2.Home Page: The home page contains an animated image and button that redirect you to the product page.

#### 3.Product Listing Page: The product listing page displays all the sweet and coffee products available on the website. The products are displayed in an attractive grid layout, and a user can filter the products based on their category(search button was was not that satisfying UX option).

4.Product Detail Page: The product detail page displays the details of the selected product. It includes the product name, image, description, price, and the option to add the product to the cart.

5.Cart section: The cart page displays all the products that the user has added to the cart. The user can update the quantity or remove the product from the cart.

6.Authentication: The website allows users to sign in with Google authentication. This enables them to add items to the cart and to make order.

7.Adding products: If you are admin you have 1 more tab where you can add new products and images to the database.

Technical Details:

ReactJS: ReactJS is used to build the website. It helps in creating reusable UI components and provides a rich set of tools and libraries to speed up the development process.

**Redux**: Redux is used to manage the state of the application. It helps in creating a centralized store for the application data, which can be accessed by any component.

**useState**: The useState hook is used to manage the state of the functional components.

**useEffect**: The useEffect hook is used to handle side effects in the functional components.

**useStateValue**: The useStateValue hook is used to access the state of the Redux store.

**Framer-Motion**: Framer-Motion is used to create the animation on the website. It provides an easy-to-use API to create complex animations and interactions.

**TailwindCSS**: TailwindCSS is used to style the website. It is a utility-first CSS framework that helps in creating responsive and consistent UI designs.

**Firebase**: Firebase is used to host the website and store the application data. It provides a real-time database, storage, and authentication services which are used to manage the user data.

### **BONUS**:

Due to timelimit i didn't manage to give the 100% user experience that i've wanted.
I've created **Rive** **animations** but was not perfect to implemented it here is a link for one of them:
